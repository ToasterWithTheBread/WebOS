# WebOS
I made this project because I thought it was going to be a lot more complicated and a cool showcase of skill. It took me two hours.

# Setting up
The public directory has an apps section, just increment each folder by one so the website can find it, then modify the config file in each folder and edit the HTML.

Because each folder has its own app directory and uses HTML, the possibilities are endless, go crazy.
